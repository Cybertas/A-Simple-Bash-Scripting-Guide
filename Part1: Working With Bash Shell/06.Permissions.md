# Permissions 
- Linux has the capability to provide access to multiple users. Thus permissions are essential for security and access control.   
- Permissions represent the access rights granted to users, groups, and other entities for files and directories. 
- Overview:
    - [Permission Types & Identities](#permission-types--identities)
    - [Modify Permissions - Change File Permission](#modify-permissions---change-file-permission)
    - [Modifying Identifies - Change Owner and Group](#modifying-identifies---change-owner-and-group)
    - [Modifying Identities - Change Group Ownership](#modifying-identities---change-group-ownership)
    - [Other Permission Concepts](#other-permission-concepts)

## Permission Types & Identities
- There are three types of permissions: 
    1. **Read (r)**: Allows reading a file's contents or listing a directory's contents.
    2. **Write (w)**: Allows modifying or deleting a file and creating, deleting, or renaming files within a directory.
    3. **Execute (x)**: Allows executing a file or accessing files within a directory.
- Permissions can be applied to three different identities:
    1. **Owner (u)**: The user who created the file or directory, or the user who is currently the owner.
    2. **Group (g)**: The group associated with the file or directory.
    3. **Other (o)**: All other users who are not the owner or part of the group.

- File type strings:
    1. "-" indicates a regular file.
    2. "d" indicates a directory.
    3. "l" indicates a symbolic link.
    4. "c" indicates a character special file.
    5. "b" indicates a block special file.
    6. "p" indicates a named pipe (FIFO).
    7. "s" indicates a socket.

    ```bash
    ## list all items and its permission in a directory 
    dev@dev: ls -l
    drwxr-xr-x  2 dev group1 4096 Dec  7 07:39 dir1
    -rw-rw-r--  1 dev group2 4096 Feb 27 16:45 file1
    
    ## dir1 is a directory has "d" as most left bit
    ## dir1 allows read, write and execute for owner
    ## dir1 allows read and execute for group
    ## dir1 allows execute for everyone else 
    ## dir1 has group1 as group 

    ## file1 is a file has "-" as most left bit
    ## file1 allows read and write for owner
    ## file1 allows read and write for group
    ## file1 allows read only for everyone else
    ## file1 has group2 as group
    ```
    
## Modify Permissions - Change File/Directory Permission
- The <code>chmod</code> command can be used to modify permissions for each category.
- There are two modes to set permissions: Symbolic Mode and Numeric Mode.
    - Symbolic Mode: Uses letters to set permissions (e.g., `u+x`).
    - Numeric Mode: Uses octal to set permissions (e.g., `chmod 777 file1`).
    - [Permission Mode Table](./_Permissions%20Examples.md)

    ```bash
    ## list contents in a directory 
    dev@dev: ls -l
    drwxr-xr-x  2 dev group1 4096 Dec  7 07:39 dir1
    -rw-rw-r--  1 dev group2 4096 Feb 27 16:45 file1
    
    ## there are two main ways to assign permission 
    ## Symbolic Mode and Numeric Mode
    ## owner(u), group(g), other(o), all(a)


    ## Symbolic Mode
    ## add execute permission for others on file1
    dev@dev: chmod u+x file1 

    ## remove execute permissions on owner,group and other on dir1
    dev@dev: chmod ugo-x dir1

    ## remove all execute permissions on dir1
    dev@dev: chmod a-x dir1

    ## set readonly permission for group
    dev@dev: chmod g=r file1

    ## Numeric mode 
    ## provide read,write and execute permission to owner, group and others
    dev@dev: chmod 777 file1

    ## provide read,write and execute to owner
    ## provide read, write to group
    ## provide read only to others
    dev@dev: chmod 764 file1
    ```
## Modifying Identifies - Change Owner and Group
- The <code>chmod</code> command changes the owner and optionally the group of a file or directory.
- Syntax: <code>chown owner:group file_name</code>.

    ```bash
    ## list contents in a directory 
    dev@dev: ls -l
    drwxr-xr-x  2 dev group1 4096 Dec  7 07:39 dir1
    -rw-rw-r--  1 dev group2 4096 Feb 27 16:45 file1
    
    ## change owner to test_user for file1
    dev@dev: sudo chown test_user file1 && ls -l
    drwxr-xr-x  2 dev group1 4096 Dec  7 07:39 dir1
    -rw-rw-r--  1 test_user group2 4096 Feb 27 16:45 file1

    ## change owner and group to test_user and test_group for dir1
    dev@dev: sudo chown test_user:test_group dir1 && ls -l
    drwxr-xr-x  2 test_user test_group 4096 Dec  7 07:39 dir1
    -rw-rw-r--  1 test_user group2 4096 Feb 27 16:45 file1

    ## change group ownership to dev for dir1
    dev@dev sudo chown test_user:dev dir1 && ls -l
    drwxr-xr-x  2 test_user dev 4096 Dec  7 07:39 dir1
    -rw-rw-r--  1 test_user group2 4096 Feb 27 16:45 file1
    ```

## Modifying Identities - Change Group Ownership 
- The <code>chgrp</code> command changes the group of a file or directory.
- [chgrp Examples](./_Permissions%20Examples.md#chgrp-example)

## Other Permission Concepts
- **setuid (set user ID)**: Allows users to run a program with the permissions of the file's owner.
    - [setuid Examples](./_Permissions%20Examples.md#setuid-example)
 - setgid(set group ID): Allows users to run a program with the group's permission.
    - [setgid Examples](./_Permissions%20Examples.md#setgid-example)
 - Sticky Bit: Restricts the ability to delete or rename files within a directory to the file's owner, the directory's owner, or the root user regardless of the file's individual permissions.
