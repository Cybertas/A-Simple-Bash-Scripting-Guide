## Important Note
1. Firstly, I would like to give a shout out to "The Linux Command Line" by William Shotts. Majority of this guide is summarized from "The Linux Command Line." To learn more about Bash, recommend checking out [The Linux Command Line](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php).
2. Practice is an indispensable part of mastering any skill. To use Bash efficiently, I recommend practicing along.

## What is Bash?
- Bash, short for "Bourne Again SHell," is a command-line shell and scripting language.
- A shell is a program that takes keyboard inputs/commands and passes them to the operating system to carry out tasks.
- Bash functions as a scripting language, enabling users to automate tasks by writing sequences of commands in script form.
