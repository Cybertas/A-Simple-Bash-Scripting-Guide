# Archive & Compression 
 - Compression can to applied to files to reduce their size.
 - Compression can be lossless, which the original data is preserved when reconstructed or lossy which the some information is discarded in the compression process.
 - Archiving is the process of gathering up multiple files and directories and building them together into a single large file. 
 - The purpose of archiving is to consolidate files for easier storage, organization and transportation. 
 - Archiving also preserves the file structure and metadata of the original files. 
 - Archives can be compressed for backup and distribution.

 ## Compression 
 - The <code>gzip</code> command can be used to compress or expand files.
 - The <code>gunzip</code> command can be used to expand files. 
 - When executed, it replaces the original file with a compressed version of the original and vice versa. 

```bash
```


 ## Archive
 - Archiving is often done as part of system backups. 
 - The <code>tar</code> command can be used to archive files. 
 - File has **.tar** as filetype is an archived file and **.tgz** is zipped archived file.
