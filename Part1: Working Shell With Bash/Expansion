# Shell Expansion 

## Introduction
- When shell receives a command, bash performs several processes upon the input before it carries out of the command.
- With expansion, when we type something and it is expanded into something else before the shell acts upon it.

- Below is the list of expansions:
    - [Pathname Expansion](#pathname-expansion)
    - [Tilde Expansion](#tilde-expansion)
    - [Arithmetic Expansion](#arithmetic-expansion)
    - [Brace Expansion](#brace-expansion)
    - [Parameter Expansion](#parameter-expansion)
    - [Command Substitution](#command-substitution)

## Pathname Expansion
- Bash supports three simple wildcards:
    1. &nbsp; \* &nbsp; - &nbsp; Matches any strings, including the null string.
    2. &nbsp; ? &nbsp; - &nbsp; Matches any single character.
    3. &nbsp; [...] &nbsp; - &nbsp; Matches any one of the enclosed characters.  
      <br />
    ```bash
    ##trying to match everything in the working directory with * character
    dev@dev: ls * 
    Desktop Documents Downloads ...


    ##create a file called '1' and match it with ? character
    dev@dev: touch 1 && echo ? 
    1 

    ##create files 1 123 a and match with case [123a]
    dev@dev: touch 1 123 a && echo [123a]
    1 a
    ```
