# The Environment 
- The shell keeps track of information during a shell session called environment.
- Programs use data stored in the environment to determine the system's configurations. 
- Shell stores two basic types of data in the environment.<br>
    1. Environment variables: Environment variables are commonly used to pass information between processes or to configure the behavior of programs.  They are accessible to all processes that are spawned from the shell.
    2. Shell variables: Shell variables are used to store temporary data within a shell script or session. They are not visible to external programs or other shell instances.
