# Commands - What are they?
- Commands can be:
    - An executable program
    - A built-in command to the shell
    - A shell function
    - An alias of a command

# Introduction
- A command provides instructions to the underlying system to carry out.
- Bash acts as an interface between a user and the operating system, whereby a user evokes commands in Bash to interact with the underlying operating system. 
- Below is a snippet of a command (ls), which lists all files in the working directory. 
- Note: Bash takes commands literally meaning (Ls) does not equal to (ls)
    ```bash
    dev@dev: ls 

    file1 file2 file3

    dev@dev: Ls
    Ls: command not found
    ```

# Flags 
- Often commands accept flags or options, which modifies or provides additional features of the original command. 
- Below is a snippet of command (ls) with additional flag (-l).
- Lists all the files in the working directory with outputing the result as list format. 
    ```bash
    dev@dev: ls -l

    -rw-rw-r-- 1 dev dev 5 Jan 28 18:20 file1
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 dev dev 5 Jan 28 18:20 file2
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 dev dev 5 Jan 28 18:20 file3
    ```
