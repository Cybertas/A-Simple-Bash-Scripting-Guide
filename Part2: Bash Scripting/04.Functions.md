# Functions
 - Shell functions can be used to break the script down into modular pieces. 
 - In other words, they are mini scripts that are located inside a script and can act as autonomous programs. 
 - The syntax for shell functions can be expressed in two forms:
 - Shell function syntax: 
    
    ```bash
    ## Two syntax forms for defining functions
    # 1. More formal form
    function name{
        commands
        return
    }
    # 2. More preferred form
    name(){
        commands
        return
    }
    ```
## Exit Status 
 - Commands including scripts and shell function returns a value to the system when they terminate called an exit status. 
 - This value indicates the success or failure of the command's execution.
 - Exit status value ranges from 0 - 255, by convention a value of zero indicates success and any other value indicates failure. 
 - The shell provides a parameter that can be used to examine the exit status - `$?`.
 - Example below:
    
    ```bash
    dev@dev: ls -d /usr/bin ## this command executed without any error
    /usr/bin
    dev@dev: echo $? ## thus returns 0 as exit status
    0 
    
    dev@dev: ls -d /bin/usr ## this command executed with error 
    ls: cannot access /bin/usr: No such file or directory
    dev@dev: echo $? ## thus return non zero exit status
    ```
- Example using function:

    ```bash
    ## test function using return statement to return an integer of value 0 which means this function has executed successfully.
    function test(){
        echo "This is a test function"
        return 0
    }
    test 
    echo $? ## check the value returned 

    ## output
    This is a test function
    0 ## this is exit status
    ```

## Handling Function Return
 - In Bash, the return statement in a function can only return it's own exit status. To retrieve the exit status use `$?`.
 - One of the workarounds is to capture the standard output of the return function.
 - Below example below on handling return value in Bash:
    
    ```bash
    ## below script outputs two values, one is using return statement
    ## one is capturing stdout from child function

    #!/bin/bash
    function child_using_stdout(){ 
    echo "Hello World"
    }


    function child_using_return(){
    return 35
    }

    function parent(){
    return_value_stdout=$(child_using_stdout)
    echo "value returned using stdout: $return_value_stdout"

    child_using_return
    return_value=$?

    echo "value returned using return: $return_value"
    }

    parent

    ## output
    value returned using stdout: Hello World
    value returned using return: 35
    ```

## Function Examples
- For more on [Functions Examples](./_Functions%20Examples.md) and below is an example on function: 
- Below is an example of a function to add a new user. It check if the user already exists and creates a new user if not, generating a password file in the working directory.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash 
    ## a custom function to add a new user
    ## first will ask user to enter a new user name and check if exists
    ## if user does not exist then create a user and generate a password file in the working directory 
    addUser(){
        echo "Creating new user..."
        read -p "Please enter username: " username
        if  id "$username" &> /dev/null; then ## check if username has been used
            echo "User $username exists, please try a new username" 
        else ## create user
            ## add user account with home directory 
            useradd "$username" -m
            echo "$username has been created"

            ## set user password
            passwd=$username
            passwd+=$RANDOM 
            passwd=$(echo $passwd | md5sum | cut -c 1-32)
            echo "$username:$passwd" | chpasswd	
            echo $passwd > password.txt
            echo "Password has been generated, please check the password.txt file at working directory" 
        fi	
    }

    main(){
        ## calling function from main
        addUser
    }

    ```
