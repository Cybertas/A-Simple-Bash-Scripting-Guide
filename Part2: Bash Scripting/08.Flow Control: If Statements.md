# Flow Control: If Statements
 - If statement can be used to perform an action or series of actions based on true or false conditions.
 - Below is syntax of if statement in Bash. 

    ``` bash
    if [ CONDITION ]; then
        COMMANDS
    elif [ CONDITION ]; then
        COMMANDS
    else 
        COMMANDS
    fi
    ## Note: space is require between [] and CONDITION
    ```
 - THe `if` statement evaluates the CONDITION and if CONDITION is true then execute COMMANDS. 
 - `elif` is evaluated next when if returns false.
 - `else` is the last statement that executes when none of the if statements are true.

## Condition Checking with Test
 - In Bash the `if` command is often used with the `test` command where `test` command performs a variety of checks and if command checks the value returned by test then performs some actions if the value returned is true.
 - Below are three forms of the `test` command:
    - `test expression` - command expression form, where `test` evaluated as either true or false and return and value of 0 when true and 1 as false.
    - `[expression]` - symbolic expression, where `[]` is equivalent to `test` and expression within the brackets gets evaluated. 
    - `[[expression]]`- enhanced version, with addition of regex string expression. 
 - Examples below: 
    
    ```bash
    ## if statement without test
    dev@dev: if true; then echo 'this is true'; fi
    this is true

    ## if statement using test
    dev@dev: fruit=apple && if [ "$fruit" == "apple" ]; then echo 'this is true';fi
    this is true
    ```


 ## Comparison Operators for Test
  - Bash unlike other programming languages e.g. Python where comparison operator can be used on different data types, the `test` command requires specific comparison operator for different types of data its evaluating. 
  - Below are three data types `test` can evaluate:
    - File - [File Comparison Operators](./_Flow%20control:%20If%20Statements%20Examples.md#file-comparison-operators)
    - String - [String Comparison Operators](./_Flow%20control:%20If%20Statements%20Examples.md#string-comparison-operators)
    - Integer - [Integer Comparison Operators](./_Flow%20control:%20If%20Statements%20Examples.md#integer-comparison-operators)

### File Comparison Examples
 - For additional operator - [File Comparison Operators](./_Flow%20control:%20If%20Statements%20Examples.md#file-comparison-operators)
 - Below are some examples on file comparison: 

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    # test-file: evaluate the status of a file
    FILE=~/.bashrc
    
    ## -e option checks if a file exists
    if [ -e "$FILE" ]; then
        
        ## -f option checks if file exists and is a regular file
        if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
            echo "$FILE is a regular file."
        fi

        ## -d option checks if file exists and is a directory
        if [ -d "$FILE" ]; then
            echo "$FILE is a directory."
        fi

        ## -r option check if file exists and is readable
        if [ -r "$FILE" ]; then
            echo "$FILE is readable."
        fi

        ## -w option check if file exists and is writable 
        if [ -w "$FILE" ]; then
            echo "$FILE is writable."
        fi
        ## -x option checks if file exists and is executable
        if [ -x "$FILE" ]; then
            echo "$FILE is executable/searchable."
        fi
    else
            echo "$FILE does not exist"
        exit 1
    fi
    exit
    ```


### String Comparison Examples
 - For additional operators - [String Comparison Operators](./_Flow%20control:%20If%20Statements%20Examples.md#string-comparison-operators)
 - Below are examples on string comparison:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # test-string: string comparison

    str=""
    str1="Hello"
    str2="World!"
    
    if [ -n "$str" ]; then
        echo "str is not null."
    else
        echo "str is null."
    fi

    if [ "$str1" == "$str2" ]; then
        echo "str1 equals to str2." 
    else  
        echo "str1 does not equal to str2."
    fi

    ## output: 
    ## null
    ## str1 does not equal to str2

    ```


### Integer Comparison Examples
 - For additional operators - [Integer Comparison Operators](./_Flow%20control:%20If%20Statements%20Examples.md#integer-comparison-operators)
 - Below are examples on integer comparison:  

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # test-integer: evaluate the value of an integer.

    INT=-5

    if [ "$INT" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "INT is zero."
    else
        if [ "$INT" -lt 0 ]; then
            echo "INT is negative."
        else
            echo "INT is positive."
        fi

        if [ $((INT % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "INT is even."
        else
            echo "INT is odd."
        fi
    fi

    ## output:
    ## INT is negative.
    ## INT is odd.
    ```

## Boolean Logical Operators - AND, OR, NOT
- Logical operators can be used to combine expression.
- Below is a table that contains operators that can be used in Bash to present the logical operators. 

   |   Operation   |   test command   |   [[]] and (())   |
   | ------------- |  --------------  |   --------------  |
   |  AND          | -a               |    &&             |
   |  OR           | -o               |    ||             |
   |  NOT          | !                |    !              |

- The test command accepts both option notation as well as symbolic notion.
- Below are examples on logical operators:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    str1="Hello"
    str2="World"

    int1=5
    int2=5

    if [[ "$str1" == "$str2" && "$int1" -eq "$int2" ]]; then
        echo "both str and int are same."

    elif [[ "$str1" == "$str2" && "$int1" -ne "$int2" ]]; then
        echo "strings are same, integers are not."

    elif [[ "$str1" != "$str2" && "$int1" -eq "$int2" ]]; then
        echo "strings are not the same, integers are."

    else
        echo "neither are the same" 
    fi

    ## output:
    strings are not the same, integers are.

    ```
